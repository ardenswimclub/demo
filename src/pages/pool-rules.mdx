# Pool Rules

The following rules are established to protect the health and promote the safety of The Arden Swim Club members and guests, to ensure their enjoyment of the The Arden Swim Club's facilities, to provide for orderly operation of the The Arden Swim Club, and to enhance the standing of the The Arden Swim Club in the community. Compliance with these rules is, therefore, the responsibility of The Arden Swim Club members for themselves, their families, and their guests. 

The Arden Swim Club's mission is to provide a fun, relaxed and family-friendly atmosphere, however, our first concern is the safety of our members, especially our children. Parental cooperation and supervision is essential to this purpose. It is critical, therefore, that all parents instruct their children to observe all rules and to obey the Pool Manager, lifeguards and all staff. Serious and repeated infractions of the The Arden Swim Club's rules may be cause for disciplinary action by the Pool Manager and/or the Board of Directors, and can be considered sufficient cause for cancellation of membership and forfeiture of dues. All members are expected to know the rules, and to cooperate with the Pool Manager and staff in the performance of their duties.

* All Arden Swim Club members shall sign in at the entrance to the pool prior to entering the pool area. 
* Guests must be accompanied by a The Arden Swim Club member. Guests shall enter their names in the guest register, along with the name of the sponsoring The Arden Swim Club member, and shall pay applicable daily guest fees. There is a limit of six times a season that a local individual may be sponsored as a guest.
* Day Pass Walk Ups Memberships are no longer available due to insurance.
* Associate Member – An associate member is a dependent or other person associated with the household of an active member. An associate membership may include a designated day care provider, a child in care-for-hire of an adult member, grandparents and out of town house visitors. Associate members shall register their names upon entering the pool area. 
* Special conditions for guests not clearly defined in the above shall be referred to the Board of Directors for decision. 

# Unaccompanied minors

## Children of members unaccompanied by an adult will be admitted to the pool area as follows:  

* Children who are 6 and under MUST be accompanied by a parent or responsible adult (18 year of age and older) at all times. 
* Children who are 9 years of age or less must be accompanied and supervised by someone who is at least 13 years of age. 
* Children who are 10 through 12 years of age may be admitted to the pool area without an adult provided the parents have indicated their consent by signing the The Arden Swim Club Consent Form, and only after such child has been "passed off" by the Pool Manager or lifeguard on duty as being able to swim at least one length of the pool and to tread water for at least 90 seconds. 
* If a pool closing occurs while a child is at the pool unaccompanied, parents must be available or have made arrangements to have their child picked up by a responsible adult. Neither the Arden Clubs nor the The Arden Swim Club can be responsible for any child left outside the pool facilities once it has closed. If any child who is unaccompanied by an adult is asked to leave the pool more than three times during the course of the summer for disciplinary reasons, that child will not be permitted entry to the pool area without a supervising adult. Any guest of a member who is under 16 years of age must have written permission of the adult membership holder to be signed in at the pool and will be subject to the aforementioned “passed off” tests.
* When the pool is closed, only authorized persons on specific business will be permitted in the pool area. 
* Members, guests or day pass holders showing evidence of skin diseases, open sores, infectious eyes, cold, nasal or ear discharges or any other communicable disease or condition will not be permitted in the pool.
