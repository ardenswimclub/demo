Swim Team

The Arden Swim Club offers a summer swim team and is a proud member of the North Brandywine Swim League (NBSL).

Swim Team seasons runs June through July.  Practice and Swim Meets dates are posted below.    

Arden Swim Team is a fun-filled, competitive swim team open to all member children. The program is designed to bring out the best in each swimmer! 

Our Summer Swim Team program promotes physical health, positive self-esteem, dedication, and teamwork. The team is designed to help each child develop physically, mentally, and emotionally in a safe and caring environment. 

Eligibility Requirements 
In order to participate in the Arden Shark Swim Team, participants must be members of Arden Swim Club and 18 years of age or younger on June 1. To participate in a swim meet swimmers must be able to swim one lap on their stomach or back unassisted. Swimmers must also be registered via Swimmingly prior to participating in their first practice. 


REGISTRATION & FEES
Fee for the swim team is $115 per swimmer.  
Link to register: ____________________
There will be NO refunds given after June 10th. If for any reason your swimmers change their minds, you need to speak with the coaches to let them know AND email ardenswimgild@gmail.com.  Both steps need to be taken.  All refunds will be given back by July 12th.  Thank you.

PRACTICE
Practice times mean to be in the water at that time. If you need extra time for caps, goggles, etc, please come a few minutes early. Arriving late is disruptive to your coach and fellow swimmers. Please attend as many practices as possible. This is a great way to not only improve your skills, but to meet new friends and get to know your coaches and team! 

SWIM MEETS
Swim meets begin promptly at 6pm.  
Swimmers should arrive at the pool by 4:30pm so they can get their events and swimmer number. Swimmers need to be in the water at 5pm for warm-ups. 
All swimmers must be registered on the Swimmingly app to participate in the swim meets. Separate instructions were sent through email.   
Swimmingly ___________________
If your child is not able to swim in a meet, it is important that you notify the coach at least 2 days in advance. If you have an emergency and need to cancel the day of a meet, call Carrie 302-383-7079 or Megan 302-893-2319 who will let Coach Rob know.
In the event of rain, please arrive at the meet as scheduled unless notified otherwise. Meets rarely get canceled due to inclement weather. In the event of cancellation, the meet will be rescheduled the following night.
VOLUNTEERS ARE NEEDED AT EVERY SWIM MEET. We ask at least one family member to volunteer at ALL meets. Thanks in advance.
PARENTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN CHILDREN AT SWIM MEETS. Line- up volunteers are only there to place children in the correct lane. They are not there to babysit or find the children who have strayed. If you are unable to accompany your child to a meet, please make arrangements with another adult to be responsible for your child.

SWIM MEET SNACK BAR
Home meets are BIG snack bar nights. The snack bar raises money to help fund swim team activities throughout the year.
Please sign up to bring an item for home meets (June 17, 24 July 1).  
A sign-up genius will be sent out prior to each meet. 
Thank you for baking, buying & creating fun goodies to eat!
