# Swimmingly

We use [Swimmingly](https://swimmingly.app/) to help run swim meets more smoothly and efficiently.

## Here’s how it works:

* **Swimmingly Clubhouse**: This is the website where you can sign up your child for the swim team and declare which meets they will be attending.

* **SwimminglyFan**: This is an app designed for parents and spectators. It provides live results during meets, access to heat sheets, push notifications, and allows you to follow swimmers throughout the season. It’s compatible with both iPhone and Android devices.

* **Swimmingly Timer (for Volunteers)**: This version of Swimmingly is specifically for volunteers helping at the meets, including roles such as starter, timer, stroke and turn judge, and scorekeeper. This app ensures volunteers can easily access and perform their duties during meets.

We encourage all families to download the Swimmingly apps right away to stay connected and involved with the team throughout the season\!
