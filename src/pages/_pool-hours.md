| **August 29** | **Pool Closed for Arden Fair Preparations  Why?** The pool is usually open 3–8 PM. Last year, we closed early for setup. This year, we were asked to close by 3 PM. While opening from 12–3 PM was considered, limited lifeguard availability due to school starting led us to decide that remaining closed all day was the most practical choice.   |
